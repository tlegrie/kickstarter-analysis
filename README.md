# Historical Analysis of Kickstarter Campaign Results for the Theater/Plays Category/Subcategory

## Background: In April 2021, Louise requested a comprehensive historical analysis on the results of various Kickstarter campaigns within the Theater/Plays Category/Subcategory based upon a drill-down of campaign outcomes examined across various campaign launch dates and further examined by ranges of campaign funding goals. 

## To accomplish the project goals set forth by Louise, we undertook a rigorous analysis by using a comprehensive and historical Kickstarter dataset. This Kickstarter dataset included a broad range of data across the full spectrum of Kickstarter campaigns. In total, the Kickstarter dataset encompassed data for more than 4,100 unique Kickstarter campaigns. As such, undertaking and completing the requested analysis on Louise’s behalf required that we refine various elements of the dataset to evolve the dataset in order to better suit our analytical needs so that we could ultimately accomplish the analysis goals that were established by Louise as she works to evaluate how best to proceed with her own Kickstarter campaign and Theater/Play project: Fever. 

## Louise is a data-driven client, which required that we effectively ascertain tangible and actionable insights that will help her to proceed with constructive insights and with confidence in her ability to succeed in bringing her play Fever to the stage. 

### Purpose: Ultimately, the primary focus underlying the purpose of this analysis on Louise’s behalf is to empirically inform recommendations that will help Louise’s play Fever to be carried forth successfully based upon her specific campaign factors, namely launch date and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges: We completed two (2) primary analyses pursuant to Louise’s Kickstarter campaign goals for her play Fever - the outcomes of which can be found here https://github.com/tlegrie/kickstarter-analysis:

1)	Theater Outcomes by Launch Date, and;
2)	Outcomes Based on Goals.

## In terms of challenges, the initially obtained Kickstarter dataset required refinements that enabled us to drill-down on the specific factors associated with historical Theater/Play Kickstarter campaign success. Specifically, we massaged the data so that we could isolate Parent Category i.e., Theater and the corresponding Subcategory i.e., Plays, since they were previously grouped as one general category known as Category and Subcategory. This allowed us to subsegment the data in order to produce more specific and robust insights. 

## Additionally, we further refined data specific to Kickstarter campaign dates by years executed and months launched across all years. Some of the data that would have been useful in terms of the analysis that was not included within the Kickstarter dataset that we obtained included the following:

-	City within the Kickstarter campaign country, as this would have been helpful in determining whether or not there is a specific geography or city within a given country in which specific Kickstarter campaigns have historically achieved more frequent success. For example, the Theater District within New York City, specifically Broadway, is a highly concentrated center of Theater activity, and the Kickstarter dataset that we worked with did not provide that detailed level of geographical data, and;

-	Backer characteristics or some sort of Backer quality rating was also another data element that was not provided within the Kickstarter dataset. Since we can reasonably assume that all Backers are not equal in terms of ability to donate and even their respective ability to “pick a winner”, and that conceivably informed average amounts pledged/donated by Backer for each given Kickstarter campaign, it would have been helpful to have some sort of data point specific to the quality of each Backers in terms of prior pledged/donation history, as well as whether or not they had a strong track record of identifying and subsequently pledging/donating to Kickstarter campaigns that ultimately achieved success – or quite simply – picking winning Kickstarter campaigns. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: Overall, the analysis yielded favorable results in terms of historical results for Theater (Parent Category) Kickstarter campaign outcomes across the majority of launch months. On average, 61% of historical Theater Kickstarter campaigns have been successful:

#### In total, of the 1,369 historical Theater Kickstarter campaigns 839 or 61% achieved success. By month, the success rates varied, with four (4) of the twelve (12) months proving to be underperforming months relative to the historical average:

-	January was observed to have had a 58% historical Theater Kickstarter campaign success rate;
-	August was observed to have had a 59% historical Theater Kickstarter campaign success rate;
-	October was observed to have had a 57% historical Theater Kickstarter campaign success rate, and;
-	December was observed to have had the lowest historical Theater Kickstarter campaign success rate at 49%. 

#### Conversely, the remaining eight (8) months of the year were observed to have had historical Theater Kickstarter campaign success rate above or equal to the overall Theater Kickstarter campaign success rate of 61%:

-	February was observed to have had a 63% historical Theater Kickstarter campaign success rate of 63%:
-	March was observed to have a had an historical Theater Kickstarter campaign success rate equal to the overall Theater Kickstarter success rate average of 61%;
-	The following four (4) months each, respectively, have historical Theater Kickstarter campaign success rates that exceeded the overall historical Theater Kickstarter success rate: April at 63%; May at 67%; June at 65%, and; July at 63%;
-	August, October, and December underperformed relative to the overall historical Theater Kickstarter campaign average success rate at 59%, 57%, and 49%, respectively;
-	Whereas, September and November each performed in-line with the historical Theater Kickstarter campaign average success rate of 61%.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals:  In examining outcomes based upon goals, it became apparent that nearly two-thirds, equating to approximately 66%, of historical Theater Kickstarter campaigns proved to be successful on average, irrespective of the established Kickstarter campaign goal amount. However, it should be noted that in spite of the overall average success rate for Historical Kickstarter campaign results there were a total of seven (7) months that underperformed in terms of historical Theater Kickstarter campaign success rates: 

1)	Goal amounts in the ranges of $1,000 - $4,999, $10,000 - $14,999, $15,000 - $19,999, $20,000 - $24,999, $25,000 - $29,999, $40,000 - $44,999, and Greater Than $50,000 each achieved average historical Theater Kickstarter campaign success rates of below the overall average of 66%:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
