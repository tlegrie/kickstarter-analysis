# Historical Analysis of Kickstarter Campaign Results for the Theater/Plays Category/Subcategory

## Background: In April 2021, Louise requested a comprehensive historical analysis on the results of various Kickstarter campaigns within the Theater/Plays Category/Subcategory based upon a drill-down of campaign outcomes examined across various campaign launch dates and further examined by ranges of campaign funding goals. 

## To accomplish the project goals set forth by Louise, we undertook a rigorous analysis by using a comprehensive and historical Kickstarter dataset. This Kickstarter dataset included a broad range of data across the full spectrum of Kickstarter campaigns. In total, the Kickstarter dataset encompassed data for more than 4,100 unique Kickstarter campaigns. As such, undertaking and completing the requested analysis on Louise’s behalf required that we refine various elements of the dataset to evolve the dataset in order to better suit our analytical needs so that we could ultimately accomplish the analysis goals that were established by Louise as she works to evaluate how best to proceed with her own Kickstarter campaign and Theater/Play project: Fever. 

## Louise is a data-driven client, which required that we effectively ascertain tangible and actionable insights that will help her to proceed with constructive insights and with confidence in her ability to succeed in bringing her play Fever to the stage. 

### Purpose: Ultimately, the primary focus underlying the purpose of this analysis on Louise’s behalf is to empirically inform recommendations that will help Louise’s play Fever to be carried forth successfully based upon her specific campaign factors, namely launch date and funding goals.
